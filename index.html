        <h2>What is carbon credits?</h2>
        <p>
Carbon credits, also known as allowances or offsets, assign value to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. They represent the right to emit one tonne of GHGs, standardized as carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. Introduced under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, carbon credits are now a key market instrument of the Paris Agreement (Article 6) since 2015.

Governments implement a "Cap-and-Trade" system, setting emission limits for companies or countries. Entities can trade allocated emissions or purchase carbon credits. Entities exceeding their limit can buy credits from those with surplus, fostering a market-based incentive for emission reduction and clean technology investment. Carbon credits offer flexibility in achieving environmental goals within a regulated framework.</p>

        <h2>How Carbon Credits Work</h2>
        <p>Carbon credits play a crucial role in addressing climate change. Here's a simplified overview of how they work:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Emission Reduction Projects:</strong> Companies initiate projects to reduce or capture greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Verification and Certification:</strong> Independent organizations verify and certify the emission reduction projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Issuance of Carbon Credits:</strong> Credits are issued for each metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced.</li>
            <li><strong>Trading and Market Mechanism:</strong> Carbon credits are bought and sold on the carbon market to meet emission limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Offsetting Carbon Footprint:</strong> Companies and individuals purchase credits to offset their own carbon footprint.</li>
            <li><strong>Encouraging Sustainable Practices:</strong> The system incentivizes sustainable practices and the transition to a low-carbon economy.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Price of Carbon Credits</h2>
        <p>India does not ascertain any explicit price to a carbon credit and relies on external factors that determine value to each carbon credit. According to the World Bank, carbon pricing value can be determined based on the external factors, such as, cost of fuel, emission trading scheme, tax levy, excise duty, quality of project, international demand and supply of carbon etc. India, to boost its carbon credit market, recognised Carbon as a commodity and declared trading of carbon credits on Multi Commodity Exchange from January 04, 2008. Thereafter, The National Commodity and Derivative Exchange also launched trading future contact of Carbon Credits. However, the volume of such trades are stunt and the pricing of such contracts is heavily influenced by variable external factors. It is only a matter of time and need of the hour that thorough guidelines and systems to regulate carbon credit pricing should be set in place.</p>

        What is the process for project or developer to issue a voluntary carbon credit?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the voluntary carbon market, individuals, companies, or organizations can purchase or sell carbon credits without any legal obligation, such as government mandate or international agreements. Typically, the main steps involved in the voluntary carbon market are:

      <p>
        The key actors in the voluntary carbon market are:

        <h2>Buyers</h2>
        
        Individuals or organizations that purchase carbon offsets to meet their sustainability goals.
        
        <h2>Sellers</h2>
        
        Project developers (can be companies, non-profit, or individuals) or intermediaries that sell carbon carbon offsets generated by carbon emission reduction or removal projects.
        
        <h2>Standard-setters</h2>
        
        Organizations that establish rules and methodologies for quantifying and verifying emission reductions or removals achieved by projects.
        
        <h2>Verifiers</h2>
        
        Independent third-party auditors that validate and verify the emission reductions or removals claimed by project developers.
        
        <h2>Registries</h2>
        
        Online databases that record and track the issuance, ownership, transaction, and retirement of carbon credits.
